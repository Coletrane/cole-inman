            Effective Balance is a scheduled Python script that runs every day.
            It scrapes my Gmail account for SunTrust and CitiBank daily balance
            emails, determines the balance, subtracts them, and then emails me
            my "real balance" (bankAccountBalance - creditCardBalance). It is
            deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk and uses AWS Simple Email Service
            to send emails. I originally prototyped this project in Node.js but
            there is a good deal of Callback Hellâ„¢ and async issues with it.
